The predictions of the model on the test dataset are included here for 2 cases:

1. 100% spectrum masking, 25% image masking (mmae_fullmaskspectrum_quartermaskimage_redshift_predictions.csv)
2. 100% spectrum masking, 0% image masking (mmae_fullmaskspectrum_nomaskimage_redshift_predictions.csv)

In both files, 'y_test' is the ground truth spectroscopic redshift from DESI and 'y_pred' is the model's redshift prediction.
